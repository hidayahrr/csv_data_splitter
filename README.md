# Spreadsheet_data_splitter

This Python script splits a large CSV file into three smaller parts. It allows users to specify their own file path for flexibility.

Notes:
- This script assumes your CSV file is not too large for your own memory.
- If you want a different number of splits, modify the logic accordingly.
